JavaRush.ru challenge project
This is my first more or less serious project. 
This is a coding challenge from JavaRush.ru to be selected for 3 months coding practicing.
In this project I had to write a back-end to make work provided front-end page. 
The SQL database contains 40 objects, the aim was to write the programm that can apply different type of sorting, filters, etc.
Also add, delete, update entities (CRUD operations).
Project entities contain quite large amount of class types like Long, String, Double, Integer, Boolean and programm own types.
The project was signed and acepted today, so I am quiet happy.
